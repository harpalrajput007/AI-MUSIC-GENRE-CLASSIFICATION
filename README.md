## 📌 Description

Ever wondered what genre a song belongs to? This project uses audio signal processing and machine learning to classify songs into genres like **Rock**, **Jazz**, **Hip-Hop**, **Classical**, and more! 🎵

Upload a `.wav` or `.mp3` file and let the model do the magic 🪄 with audio features like **MFCC**, **Chroma**, **Tempo**, and more!

## 🧠 Tech Stack

### 🔍 Machine Learning & Audio Processing
- `Python`
- `librosa` 🎧 – Audio feature extraction
- `scikit-learn` 🤖 – Classical ML models
- `TensorFlow / PyTorch` 🧠 – Deep learning (CNN on spectrograms)

### 🌐 Web Development
- `React.js` ⚛ – Frontend
- `Node.js + Express` 🚀 – Backend API
- `MongoDB` 🗄 (optional) – Store upload history/predictions
- `WaveSurfer.js` 🌊 – Audio waveform visualization

### 🧰 Dev Tools
- `VS Code`
- `Git + GitHub`
- `Render/Heroku` for deployment (planned)

## 📁 Dataset

We are using the popular **GTZAN Genre Dataset** for training and testing.

🔗 [GTZAN Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification)

- 1000 audio tracks 🎵
- 30 seconds per track ⏱
- 10 genres: `blues`, `classical`, `country`, `disco`, `hiphop`, `jazz`, `metal`, `pop`, `reggae`, `rock`

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. 🎼 **Upload** audio file
2. 📊 **Preprocess & extract features** (MFCC, Chroma, Tempo, etc.)
3. 🧠 **Predict genre** using ML/DL model
4. 🎨 **Display** result with audio visualization + confidence score
