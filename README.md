🎶 AI Music Genre Classification 🎧
🎤 Predict the genre of any song using Machine Learning & Deep Learning!


📌 Description
Ever wondered what genre a song belongs to?
This project leverages powerful audio signal processing and AI models to classify music into genres such as Rock, Jazz, Hip-Hop, Classical, and more! 🎵

Simply upload a .wav or .mp3 file and let the model work its magic 🪄 using features like MFCC, Chroma, Tempo, and Spectrograms.

🧠 Tech Stack
🔍 Machine Learning & Audio Processing
🐍 Python

🎧 Librosa – Audio feature extraction (MFCC, Chroma, Tempo)

🤖 scikit-learn – Traditional ML models

🧠 TensorFlow / PyTorch – Deep learning with CNN (on spectrograms)

🌐 Web Development
⚛ React.js – Interactive frontend interface

🚀 Node.js + Express – Backend API for handling requests

🗄 MongoDB (Optional) – Store upload history or predictions

🌊 WaveSurfer.js – Real-time audio waveform visualization

🧰 Developer Tools
💻 VS Code

🔀 Git + GitHub

☁️ Render / Heroku – Planned deployment platform

📁 Dataset
We use the popular GTZAN Genre Dataset for training and evaluation.

🔗 GTZAN Dataset on Kaggle

🎵 1000 audio tracks

⏱ 30 seconds per track

🎼 10 genres:

blues, classical, country, disco, hiphop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, rock

🔄 Workflow
🎼 Upload an audio file

🔬 Preprocess and extract features (MFCC, Chroma, Tempo, etc.)
